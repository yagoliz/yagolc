abstract: Positioning based on aircraft signals has been proposed as an alternative
  to satellite-based positioning systems (e.g. GPS). However, so far, no deployment
  of this technique exists, and the real-world performance remains unclear. This paper
  contributes at better understanding the performance tradeoffs under realistic conditions.
  We implement SkyPos, a localization system for GPS-denied areas or location integrity
  that opportunistically uses the large availability of aircraft signals to self-localize
  receivers. We analyze SkyPos with data collected from hundreds of sensors and thousands
  of aircraft around Europe. Our results show that we can achieve median accuracy
  down to 10 m in seconds, enabling almost real-time positioning or location verification
  using aircraft signals at scale
